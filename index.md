Hi! I am Themistoklis Diamantopoulos and this is a website accompanying my PhD thesis with title:

<center style="padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:15px; font-size:125%">Mining Software Engineering Data for Software Reuse</center>

The purpose of this website is to serve as a gateway to people interested in reading and
understanding my thesis. As such, it offers information about the contents of the thesis,
and includes all relevant material.

The links to the left provide access to the main elements (abstract, full text, presentation), as well as to any supporting material (datasets, tools, etc.) for anyone that wishes to reproduce the findings of the PhD thesis. Finally, one can also view the publications produced during the undergone research of this thesis as well as citation information.

<!--
<center style="padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:15px;">Note: The thesis is currently under development, so the content of different sections is going to be added part by part as the chapters are added to the thesis. In time this website will include everything, including the final text.</center>
