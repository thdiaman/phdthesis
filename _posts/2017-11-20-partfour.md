### Chapter 9: Providing Reusability-aware Recommendations
This chapter includes the design of the Code Reuse system QualBoa. QualBoa is a
system that accepts queries for software components and recommends source code
that is assessed not only from a functional but also from a quality perspective.
The source code components are assessed for their reusability, i.e. the extent
to which they can be reused.

QualBoa is offered as an open source tool, of which the source code is available
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/authecesofteng/qualboa">here</a>.

The Boa query used to computed the metrics for the reusability model of QualBoa
is available <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/partfour/qualboa/Query.boa">here</a>.

In addition, the dataset used for evaluating QualBoa in a component reuse scenario
is available <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/partfour/qualboa/dataset.zip">here</a>.


### Chapter 10: Assessing the Reusability of Source Code Components
This chapter presents a methodology for assessing the reusability of source
code components by employing popularity and reuse information as ground truth.
The reusability model is built on a dataset of the 100 most starred and 100 most
forked GitHub Java projects, which, upon removing duplicates, amount to 137 projects.

The list of projects used for determining the correlation between stars and forks is available
<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/partfour/quality/projects.txt">here</a>.

The list of projects used for developing our model is available
<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/partfour/reusability/projects.txt">here</a>.

The evaluation is performed in a set of five software projects, out of which
three were created by developers and were downloaded from GitHub
(projects <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/realm/realm-java">realm/realm-java</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal">liferay/liferay-portal</a>, and
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security">spring-projects/spring-security</a>)
and two were auto-generated using the tools of <a target="_blank" href="http://s-case.github.io/">S-CASE</a>
(projects <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/partfour/quality/WebMarks.zip">Webmarks</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/partfour/quality/WSAT.zip">WSAT</a>).
